15-04-2013
Version 3.80
  1. Each value of the imported field can be processed using expressions in MS
     JScript. To the TQImportFieldFormat class the TqiStrings Script property
     containing the script code is added. To the TQImport3 basic class the
     ScriptEngine property of TQImport3ScriptEngine type is added. This property
     contains a reference to the component that will execute a script. The
     TQImport3ScriptEngine is the basic type, it sets the program logic and
     located in the QImport3ScriptEngine.pas module. It inherited the
     TQImport3JscriptEngine class, which works with the TScriptControl object
     from the QImport3MSScriptControlTLB.pas module in the context of MS
     JScript. You can also write your successor of the TQImport3ScriptEngine
     class to implement random script syntax. For TQImport3JscriptEngine the
     scrip execution result corresponds to the last variable value. If you want
     to use a filed value in the script, you need to specify the field name
     enclosed in percent signs -% in TQImportFieldFormat.Script. Below there is
     an example showing how to get a field value, convert it to number and
     increase on a numeric value of the current month:
     // FieldName means a filed name
     R = %FieldName%;
     var D = New Date();
     k = parseInt(R) + D.getMonth() + 1;
     If a script for the field is set, it will have the highest priority in the
     field processing. I.e. the generator will not start, if it is set, etc.

  2. Now, instead of the imported field value the following values can be
     substituted: current date, current time, current date and time, full name
     of the imported file, short name of the imported file.
     To the TQImportFieldFormat class the Functions property of
     TQImportFunctions = (ifNone, ifDate, ifTime, ifDateTime, ifLongFileName,
     ifShortFileName) type is added;
  3. QImport3HTML. Data from the files was imported. Fixed now.
  4. If format masks correspond to system masks, they were not saved in the dfm
     file. Fixed now.
  5. QImport3Xlsx. The InlineStr cell values were not imported. Fixed now.
  6. QImport3ASCII. Some errors occurred while working with CSV files. Fixed now.
  7. Other improvements and bug fixes.

12-10-2012
Version 3.70
  1. Support of RAD Studio XE3 is added.

     contained line break characters in the field values were displayed incorrectly. 
     Fixed now.
  7. QImport3Wizard. When importing from CSV and TXT, incorrect default encoding 
     applied. Fixed now.
  8. QImport3Wizard. Import from TXT. When loading a template in the MAP property 
     settings, values of the block position and size were reversed. Fixed now.
  9. QImport3Wizard. Even if the import process is fully complete, ProgressBar 
     did not show 100% completion for some types of import. Fixed now.
  10. Other improvements and bugfixes.

30-03-2012
Version 3.60
  1. Added the �Functions� property (TQImportFunctions = (ifNone, ifDate, ifTime, 
     ifDateTime, ifLongFileName, ifShortFileName) to
     the TQImportFieldFormat class. This property allows to replace the imported 
     value to the corresponding current date, current time, current date and time, 
     the full name of the imported file, the short name of the imported file.
  2. QImport3Xlsx. Restored the compatibility with the old-format config-file.
  3. QImport3Xlsx. When setting a custom data format for numbers in an Excel cell,
     the date format was applied to the imported values. Fixed now.

     an error occurred. Fixed now.
  8. QImport3Xls. The absence of data in a column or in a row caused the error. 
     Fixed now.
  9. Other improvements and bugfixes.

14-12-2011
Version 3.50
  1. TQImport3XML. Unicode support is added.
  2. TQImport3Xlsx. The parsing logic of the Map property has been changed, now

     - sheet name - [Sheet2]B1-B6;
     - sheet number - [:3]D4-D9;
     - several cellsets for the same field - [Sheet2]C12-C2;[:1]A1-A8;
  3. Added the AutoTrimValue property. When AutoTrimValue = True, the Trim 
     function will be applied to each string value.
  4. Added the ImportEmptyRows property. When ImportEmptyRows = False, the empty 
     strings will not be imported.

   when importing from TXT file. Fixed now.
3. Import2Wizard and ADO_Import2Wizard. With the Show Error Log after import 
   flag on the error log file was not shown. Fixed now.
4. Import2Wizard � ADO_Import2Wizard. The repeated load of the template 
   file (without closing the ImportWizard) caused the duplication of the values 
   in the Replacements list. Fixed now.
5. Import2Wizard and ADO_Import2Wizard.  With AutoLoadTemplate and 
   AutoSaveTemplate options on there were some problems with loading and 
   writing of the template. Fixed now.

12-28-2004
Version 2.20

1. Delphi 2005 support.
2. Now Quick Import can use several languages in one project. By default, it   
   works with resources that are linked into .BPL file. If you need            
   multi-language support in your project, make several language DLLs          
   and switch to particular language by this code:                             
                                                                              
   uses QImport2;                                                              
                                                                              
   QImportLocale.LoadDll('QIEnglish.dll'); // load English resources           
   ...                                                                         
   QImportLocale.UnloadDll; // unload resource DLL and use default resources   
                                                                              
   To make the DLL, run MakeDll.bat file in this folder, or MakeAll.bat file   
   in the LANGUAGES folder to make DLLs for all languages.                     

3. We have tried to solve the problem with importing Date/Time fields. 
   As a result we have improved the TQImport2.StringToField method where 
   you will be able to find new functions: TryStrToDateTime, FormatStrToDateTime.   

4. Also new event handler OnImportRowComplete was added to the base class TQImport2.
   This event takes place when the import of row is complete.
   
5. Some small improvements and bugfixes.

08-12-2003
Version 2.10

1. We have added the OnDestinationLocate event to all components of the 
   suite including the TQImport2Wizard and TADOQImport2Wizard components. 
   This event can be used when it is necessary to find a row by key values in the 
   TDataset or TDBGrid destinations and allows you to control defining 
   of the search condition parameters.

2. We have added the WriteOnFly property in the TQImport2XML component. This 
   property determines how the source xml file will be read and imported. If 
   WriteOnFly is set to false then the source file will be read and parsed 
   completely, and after that the prepared data will be imported to the 
   destination object (e.g. TDataSet, TDBGrid etc.). If WriteOnFly is set to true 
   each tag will be read, parsed and imported separately without temporary saving 
   to memory. Corresponding options are added in the TQImport2Wizard and 
   TADO_QImport2Wizard components.

3. We have improved the Excel Map Editor in the TQImport2Wizard and 
   TADO_QImport2Wizard components. Now you have a possibility of selecting one
   or more columns or rows by one click. Press the Ctrl key and click on any column header
   to select a whole column or click on the row number to select a whole
   row. Use the Shift key to select a range of columns or rows.

4. The Formats property editor available from the TADO_QImport2Wizard component now.

5. A bug with displaying the SkipCols and SkipRows values in the Excel Map 
   Editor in the TQImport2Wizard and TADO_QImport2Wizard components is fixed 
   now.

6. Some small improvements and bugfixes.

06-17-2003
Version 2.00

1. We have added a possibility of importing data from different Excel sheets. 
   You can import data from a single Excel sheet or from several Excel sheets
   at once.

2. Now it is possible to import formulas from Excel. You can add cells 
   containing formulas to an imported range and get the formula result in your
   import destination.

3. We have added a possibility of defining relative ranges in the Map property 
   of the TQImportXLS component. This feature allows to define import 
   ranges without linking to certain cell numbers e.g.:

   Field1=[Sheet 1]A-ColFinish;
   Field2=[Sheet 1]B-ColStart;

   You don't have to know where exactly your data start or finish. 

4. We have implemented import from XML format. You can import data from XML 
   files created via our QuickExport component suite 
   http://www.ems-hitech.com/quickexport
   or via the SaveToFile method of the TClientDataSet component.

5. Now it is possible to import data into an user defined destination. 
   You should set the ImportDestination property to qidUserDefined and call the 
   Execute method. In this case you should use the OnUserDefinedImport event to 
   manipulate imported data according to your purpose.

6. Some new published properties are added to the Wizard components:
   - property TXTViewRows: integer;
   - property CSVViewRows: integer;
   - property ExcelViewRows: integer;
   - property ExcelMaxColWidth: integer;

   These properties allow flexible tuning of the wizard appearance. Using the
   first three properties you can define how many records are shown in the 
   corresponding viewer. The last property defines the max width of the columns
   in the Excel viewer.

7. We have added the OnLoadTemplate event to the Wizard components. This event 
   allows to perform any actions with the template file before it is loaded.

8. A possibility of defining case insensitive replacements is implemented. Use
   the CaseIgnore property of the TQImportReplacement object in all components 
   of the suite.

9. The appearance of the Import Wizards is improved significantly. We hope 
   you will like its new interface.

10. Some other improvements and bugfixes.


04-29-2003
Version 1.80

1. The ShowErrorLog and the ErrorLogFileName properties are added to each
   component of the set.

2. A possibility of starting import process from the Map page in ImportWizard
   is added. Now you can execute import immediately after the accordance
   between destination and source columns is defined.

3. The GoToLastPageAfterLoadTemplate property added to the Wizard components.
   Now you can skip several wizard steps after the import template loaded.

4. The CloseAfterImport property is added to the wizard components. Set this
   property to true to close Import Wizard when import process is finished.

5. A bug with importing Date type data from Excel is fixed.

6. Some small improvements and bugfixes.

03-03-2003
Version 1.70

1. A possibility of importing data to different destination is added.
   Now you can import your data to TDataSet, TDBGrid, TListView, TStringGrid
   or any decendants of them.

2. A possibility of defining the importing mode is added. You can define how
