Enter text within the Find Panel's box and the tree list will highlight found text matches in all visible nodes. The Find box shows the ordinal number of the search result corresponding to the current focus position and the total number of visible search results. The latter number changes every time you collapse or expand a node that has nested nodes with found matches.

Use the Behavior combo box to switch the Find Panel from Search to Filter mode. In the latter case, the tree list also filters out all visible nodes that do not meet the specified criteria.

Check the "Use Extended Syntax" option to provide multiple search or filter criteria in a search string. The tree list interprets words separated by a spacebar character as individual criteria joined with the OR logical operator. The tree list highlights matching text in all nodes that meet at least one of these criteria. To search a string including one or more spacebars as a single criterion, enclose the string in quotation marks. In addition to spacebars, the extended syntax allows you to use the following specifiers and wildcards to narrow search results:

- The "+" specifier. Preceding a criterion with this specifier causes the grid to highlight or display only nodes that match this condition. The "+" specifier implements the logical AND operator. There should be no space character between the "+" sign and the criterion.
- The "–" specifier. Preceding a criterion with "–" excludes nodes that match this criterion from search results. There should be no space between the "–" sign and the criterion.
- The percent ("%") wildcard. This wildcard substitutes any number of characters in a criterion.
- The underscore ("_") wildcard. This wildcard substitutes any single character in a criterion.

Try various options to adjust the Find Panel's look & feel.

All the editing and layout customization capabilities are enabled in this demo for you to try them out in combination with the Find Panel.
