A calculated filter item compares a column value to the result of a formula expression instead of to a constant value. The expression of a calculated filter item follows Microsoft Excel's formula-compatible syntax, except for references, and can include constants, references to fields, and function calls separated by operators. Calculated filter items use values obtained from referred fields to calculate results for each node. To refer to a field, enclose its name in square brackets.

Click the Customize... button to invoke the Filter builder dialog. Check the three filter conditions with calculated field items whose expressions refer to the List Price and To fields. To edit these expressions, close the Filter builder dialog, check Editable Expressions, and invoke the dialog again. Then, click any "f(x)" button to invoke the Expression Editor dialog. This dialog allows you to preview and edit the expression for the corresponding filter item. Select the Fields category in the dialog and double-click any listed field to insert it at the current caret position. You can also type the field's name enclosed in square brackets or double-click a built-in constant, operator, or function to add it to the expression. Click OK to apply all the changes made to the expression.
