In this demo, you can:

- Scroll through the list, select one or more items, switch the expanded state of groups, and drag and drop report columns to rearrange their items.
- Try the appearance and behavior options displayed to the right of the ListView control.
- Apply different paint styles to a form (the Look&Feel menu item).
